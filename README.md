**Note:** Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4. In short, your may use it for your resumé, but not for a commercial project.

**How to print or save it as PDF?**  
Right-click → Print.

**Does it support A4 and Letter paper sizes?**  
Yes, replace all `-letter` classes with `-a4`, and uncomment specified code blocks.

**What font does it use?**  
Per [Butterick’s](https://practicaltypography.com/) free fonts recommendations, I’ve chosen IBM Plex.

**Why it’s made?**  
I couldn’t find any formal or professional resumé (CV) website with good typography, that is optimized for print, pdf, and mobile. Also, researching what recruiters want, my priorities were fast scanning time and all content to fit on one page.

How to run it
---------

Navigate to the base directory:

```
cd universal-resume
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```
npm run serve
```

For the CSS optimizations, run this:

```
npm run public
```

Starting Point
---------

`public/index.html` is the location where the content is inserted. By copy-pasting HTML — add pages, sections, articles, or other types.

`npm run public` will make **public** directory ready for drag-n-drop to, for example, https://app.netlify.com/drop (registration required beforehand).

Tailwind CSS
---------

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. It has great [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

You rarely need to do anything outside the `index.html`. Use together a bunch of pre-made utility classes that reflect a certain design system. There’s no cascade or selector specificity. The result is faster, and much more pleasurable workflow, especially long-term.

Custom CSS
---------

Code from `tailwind.config.js` and `tailwind.css` compiles to `public/style.css`. Default tailwind CSS is overwritten or extended with `tailwind.config.js`.

Here is the default tailwind config: [defaultConfig.stub.js](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/master/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js), and here’s the additional information from the tailwind documentation: [theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme/#app).

Need to change CSS in the old way — add a class to the HTML element and write CSS inside the `tailwind.css` file. You don’t need to follow the tailwindcss way.

Columns
---------

Beneath `<!-- Column -->`, removing `col-fill` class will make both columns equally tall.

A4 Size Variant
---------

**Important:** Page will break in the form of additional columns if there is too much content for one page.

Change the default size (letter) to A4:

**1.** Inside `public/index.html`, replace every `-letter` with `-a4`.

**2.** Inside `tailwind.config.js`, uncomment code block below `/* For A4 size */`, then comment code block below `/* For Letter size */

**3.** Inside `tailwind.css`, uncomment code below `/* For A4 size */`, then comment code below `/* For Letter size */`

Printing
---------

### Chrome

Right-click → Print.  
Also, choose the **Save as PDF** option if needed.

By expanding **More Settings**, change **Page Size** to A4 or Letter.

### Firefox

### Adobe Acrobat Reader

Blocking Search Engines
---------

Disable search engine indexing by adding the following code to the document `<head>`:

```
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```
